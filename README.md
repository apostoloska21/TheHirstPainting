This project is a Python script that generates a dot painting inspired by the works of the contemporary artist Damien Hirst. The script utilizes the Turtle graphics module to create a grid of colorful dots, emulating Hirst's iconic spot paintings.

Features: 
 * Randomized Colors: The dots are colored using a predefined palette of 26 colors, chosen randomly to ensure a unique pattern each time the script runs.
 * Turtle Graphics: Leverages the turtle module for drawing, allowing for easy visualization of the painting process.
 * Customizable Dot Grid: The script creates a 10x10 grid of dots, with each dot having a diameter of 20 units and a spacing of 50 units between them.
